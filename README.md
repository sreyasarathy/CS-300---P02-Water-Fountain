CS 300 - P02 Water Fountain 
This assignment involves developing a graphical implementation of a particle system. Particle
systems have long been used in computer graphics to render amorphous objects like: fire,
clouds, and water. The idea behind this technique is to use several small images or shapes
that together give the appearance of a large amorphous object that does not necessarily have a
clearly defined surface.1 The Graphical User Interface (GUI) of this assignment will be written
using the java processing graphic library.
